# Analysis Tool for Clair on Docker

A Dockerfile for deploying a [local docker image analysis tool](https://github.com/coreos/clair/tree/master/contrib/analyze-local-images) for [Clair](https://github.com/coreos/clair) which has been developed by Core OS as open source project.

## What is Clair

>Vulnerability data is continuously imported from a known set of sources and correlated with the indexed contents of container images in order to produce lists of vulnerabilities that threaten a container. When vulnerability data changes upstream, the previous state and new state of the vulnerability along with the images they affect can be sent via webhook to a configured endpoint. All major components can be customized programmatically at compile-time without forking the project.
